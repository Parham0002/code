The old music box sat on Mary’s dusty attic shelf, untouched for years.
One stormy evening, curiosity got the best of her.
She twisted the key, and the haunting melody began.
As the music played, shadows danced across the walls, forming familiar figures.
Her grandmother, who had passed away decades earlier, appeared, smiling gently. 
Tears filled Mary’s eyes as memories flooded back. Suddenly, the music stopped, and the shadows vanished.
The room felt empty again, but Mary clutched the music box, knowing she had briefly reunited with the love of someone she would never forget.
